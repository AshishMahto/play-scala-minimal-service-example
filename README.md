# Play Scala minimal service example

This is a basic example demonstrating the `PlayService` sbt plugin for creating simple Play-based microservices. This plugin uses the standard maven layout, not the traditional Play web layout.

It uses a custom application loader, and for demonstration purposes all the code is in a single file, `AppComponents.scala`.

If you decide you want to use Play controllers, it's easy to add your own controllers and call them from either the SIRD router in the example or a compiled router. The `RoutesCompiler` plugin can be added if you wish to compile a router using the Play routes syntax (place the file in `src/main/resources/`). In the spirit of being minimal no example of that is provided here.

The `deploy` folder contains a small script for assembling an Ã¼ber jar and deploying it to App Engine.
Feel free to update the `app.yaml` to add additional configuration, like a difference service name.
